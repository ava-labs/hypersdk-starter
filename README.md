# HyperSDK Starter

This repository is intended to provide a starter template for HyperSDK developers. It includes deployment scripts for devnet, a faucet, and an example dApp.

While it is based on MorpheusVM, the MorpheusVM code will only be included in this repository once the HyperSDK API is a bit more stable.

The faucet deployment relies on the default Morpheus private key `323b1d8f4eed5f0da9da93071b034f2dce9d2d22692c172f3cb252a64ddfafd01b057de320297c29ad0c1f589ea216869cf1938d88c9fbd70d6748323dbf2fa7`. This should be changed to a randomly generated one later.
