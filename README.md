# HyperSDK Starter

This repository is intended to provide a starter template for HyperSDK developers. It includes deployment scripts for devnet, a faucet, and an example dApp.

While it is based on MorpheusVM, the MorpheusVM code will only be included in this repository once the HyperSDK API is a bit more stable.
